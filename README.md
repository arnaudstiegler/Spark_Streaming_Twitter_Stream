Spark Streaming project using Twitter data stream.

Aim: using this small stream to monitor Spark metrics during a streaming job.

TwitterSentimentScore: setup the spark environment, create the stream and then process it. The process include a sentiment score to assess whether the tweet reflects more positive or negative emotions. However, this is not actually used for the monitoring.
